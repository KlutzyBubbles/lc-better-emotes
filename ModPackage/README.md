# BetterEmotes

NOTE: As of v1.4.1 MoreEmotes compatbility is dropped in favor of VR support, this means you will NOT see players emotes who use MoreEmotes.

## Issues (incompatiblities)

LCVR compatibility is done by enabling disableSelfEmote for anyone who has VR which stops overriding the animation controller, this also means if you have disableSelfEmote enabled no one else will see you emote.

There are config options to disable the speed changing and self emoting, these automatically get turned on when there is a known mod that isn't compatible present. But they can be turned on in the config if needed.

Other emote mods may have inconsistancies and should be the first place to check if something isnt working. They just get updated too much for me to check them manually.

Any other issues feel free to [submit an issue](https://github.com/KlutzyBubbles/lc-better-emotes/issues/new) or contact me directly via the [Lethal Company Modding Discord](https://discord.gg/XeyYqRdRGC) or PM `@KlutzyBubbles` always trying to make sure the mod is as stable as possible.

## MoreEmotesCompatiblity

While this mod is a direct modification of MoreEmotes, i try to make them compatible with each other. Below is the version that has been modified from and is the most likely one to work well with this mod, this version gets updated whenever a new version has been integrated

Version compatibility (MoreEmotes): v1.3.3

## Information

v1.4.x Adds a lot of config options, but the old file should still be compatible

Modification of https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/Sligili/More_Emotes/

- Adds VR support. Players without VR can continue flipping off their friends for having VR.
- Adds controller support. With rebinding :)
- Moves keybindings into the settings page, still has config values for defaults for modpacks
- Makes center of emote wheel not change emote
- Adds config values to alter change emote cooldown and griddy/prisyadka move speed
- Add config to add option to stop emote when on outer circle of emote wheel
- Remove the carrying scrap check to make emoting with one hand possible again (its fun)
- Some small behind the scenes changes to how things are implemented to make mod compatibility slightly better (maybe probably, in certain scenarios, but it isnt magic)

- Any change suggestions or bugs you can submit an issue or contact directly :)

## CUSTOM BINDS ⚙
### Bindings have moved to the in-game bindings under settings

Enabling/Dsiabling emotes can still be found in the config as well as griddy speed and emote cooldown

## NOTE ON CONTROLLERS!!! IMPORTANT (Probably)

There is a binding in game called 'Emote Wheel CONTROLLER ONLY', this should only ever be bound to right or left stick. Binding it to anything else will just default to right stick. ALSO binding this to a keyboard key will also default it to right stick, if you accidentally bound the key, you will have to deletethe keybind or edit your keybind file in the config folder and re launch.
